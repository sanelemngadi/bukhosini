GENERAL CAD
Offer a certain functionality that a survey boards doesnts such as:
    Topographical Surveying
    Provide partical printing - (Export to SHP, DFX, DWG)
    Working with different layers

SURVEY BOARDS
Offers a certain functionality that as general CAD doesnt such as:
    Working with diagrams (Servitude diagrams, Reconstruction diagrams, Working plans)
    Provide printing functionality - (Print to PDF)
    have a single layer (if you import the entities from general cad then choose whether to keep colors or not)

SURFACES VS LAYERS
Surfaces carries points while Layers carries all kinds of entities.

A documents can have the surfaces of difference cordinates systems (temporal surfaces) and the surfaces with the same
cordinates system as of the documet (permanent surface)
- We therefore can print any calculations from canvas or other surfaces to a certain surface
