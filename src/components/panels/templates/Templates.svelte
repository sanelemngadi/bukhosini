<h2>Templates</h2>

<!-- <div>

    templates are like diagrams, you have to drag and drop them to the page,
    then diagrams will offer the options such as add coordinates, and beacons, trig, descriptions, etc


    // the user can enter the interactive templates or the static canvas 

    for interactive mention that this is a table, this is a list, so we have the controls
    to add a list or remove a list, or add a file, etc
